# node-red-x10

A Node-RED node for processing events from a X10 remote control.

As I understand, there are multiple X10 remotes and multiple X10 receivers.
This package currently only works with one specific USB-connected X10 receiver (with USB vendor ID 0x0BC7 and USB product ID 0x0006) and [one particular remote control](https://www.pollin.de/p/pc-funkfernbedienung-x10-721815).
